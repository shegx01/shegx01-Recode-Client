## RECODE PROJECT

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/af72ec683b4f451ab7567b1fa386e9b0)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/BuildForSDGCohort2/shegx01-Recode-Client?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=BuildForSDGCohort2/shegx01-Recode-Client&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

### The problem

Most of the time when we have little issue with our project, <br/>
 the first thing
we do is doing a google search of the specific <br/> problem at
search engine like [Google](https://google.com) <br/> <br/>
After that, we will see a bunch of website URLs to help us out <br/>
including my favourite [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
A visual learner like me <br/>will jump to several links that contain videos
of the said problem<br/> to immediate get insight on how other developers addresses 
the <br/>situation with his pen and paper beside him.
The main challenge<br/> is that the likes of [youtube](https://youtube.com), [vimeo](https://vimeo.com) and 
others are designed for pleasure.<br/><br/>
**The disadvantage of this is that** <br/> 
 * We can easily be carried away from work at hand.
 * The next suggested video might not relate to what we are trying to solve as a problem
 * It isn't a learning environment. "mean we can not take note and navigate without adverts"
*Most of the time we have to be fishing out the source code from the comments

### The solution
 - Building a platform with an intuitive interface like youtube with note-taking functionality
 - Making the source code available on the video interface
 - Allowing user joining the channels and rating the video and also GitHub stars of the source code
